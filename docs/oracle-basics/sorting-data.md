## ORDER BY

### Syntax

```sql
SELECT column_1, column_2, column_3
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column_1 [ASC | DESC] [NULLS FIRST | NULLS LAST];
```

`NULLS FIRST` places NULL values before non-NULL values

`NULLS LAST` puts the NULL values after non-NULL values

Note that the `ORDER BY` clause is always the last clause in a `SELECT` statement until 12c. Now last clause is row limiting clause.

### Sort rows by column’s positions example

You don’t need to specify the column names for sorting the data. If you prefer, you can use the positions of the column in the `ORDER BY` clause.

```sql
SELECT name, credit_limit
FROM customers
ORDER BY 2 DESC, 1;
```

### Sorting rows by the result of a function or expression

```sql
SELECT customer_id, name
FROM customers
ORDER BY UPPER(name);
```

### Sorting rows by column alias

```sql
SELECT product_name,
  list_price - standard_cost AS gross_profit
FROM products
ORDER BY gross_profit DESC;
```

## ALIAS

The `AS` keyword is optional

```sql
SELECT first_name AS forename,
  last_name  AS surname
FROM employees;
```

By default, Oracle capitalizes the column heading in the query result. If you want to change the letter case of the column heading, you need to enclose it in quotation marks (“”)

```sql
SELECT first_name "Forename",
  last_name "Surname"
FROM employees;
```

### Table Alias

```sql
SELECT e.first_name employee,
  m.first_name manager
FROM employees e INNER JOIN employees m
    ON m.employee_id = e.employee_id;
```
