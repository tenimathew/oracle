## CREATE

```sql
CREATE TABLE ot.persons(
    person_id NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
    first_name VARCHAR2(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR2(50) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY(person_id)
);
```

## ALTER

The ALTER TABLE statement allows you to:

- Add one or more columns
- Modify column definition
- Drop one or more columns
- Rename columns
- Rename table

### ALTER TABLE ADD column examples

```sql
ALTER TABLE persons
ADD birthdate DATE NOT NULL;
```

```sql
ALTER TABLE persons
ADD (
    phone VARCHAR(20),
    email VARCHAR(100)
);
```

Suppose, you want to record the time at which a row is created and updated. To do so, you need to add two columns created_at and updated_at as follows:

```sql
ALTER TABLE
    members ADD(
        created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
        updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL
    );
```

To check whether a column exists in a table, you query the data from the `user_tab_cols` view

For example, the following PL/SQL block checks whether the members table has effective_date column before adding it.

```sql
SET SERVEROUTPUT ON SIZE 1000000
DECLARE
  v_col_exists NUMBER
BEGIN
  SELECT count(*) INTO v_col_exists
    FROM user_tab_cols
    WHERE column_name = 'EFFECTIVE_DATE'
      AND table_name = 'MEMBERS';

   IF (v_col_exists = 0) THEN
      EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'ALTER TABLE members ADD effective_date DATE';
   ELSE
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('The column effective_date already exists');
  END IF;
END;
/
```

### ALTER TABLE MODIFY column examples

```sql
ALTER TABLE persons MODIFY birthdate DATE NULL;
```

```sql
ALTER TABLE persons MODIFY(
    phone VARCHAR2(20) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR2(255) NOT NULL
);
```

### Modify the column’s visibility

In Oracle Database 12c, you can define table columns as invisible or visible. Invisible columns are not available for the query.

However, you can query the invisible columns by specify them explicitly in the query:

```sql
SELECT invisible_column_1, invisible_column_2
FROM table_name;
```

By default, table columns are visible. You can define invisible column when you create the table or using `ALTER TABLE MODIFY` column statement.

```sql
ALTER TABLE accounts
MODIFY full_name INVISIBLE;
```

```sql
ALTER TABLE accounts
MODIFY full_name VISIBLE;
```

### Modify virtual column

```sql
ALTER TABLE accounts
MODIFY full_name VARCHAR2(52)
GENERATED ALWAYS AS (last_name || ', ' || first_name);
```

### Modify the default value of a column

```sql
ALTER TABLE accounts
ADD status NUMBER( 1, 0 ) DEFAULT 1 NOT NULL ;
```

### ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN example

```sql
ALTER TABLE persons
DROP COLUMN birthdate;
```

```sql
ALTER TABLE persons
DROP ( email, phone );
```

### ALTER TABLE RENAME column example

```sql
ALTER TABLE persons
RENAME COLUMN first_name TO forename;
```

### ALTER TABLE RENAME table example

```sql
ALTER TABLE persons RENAME TO people;
```

## RENAME

```sql
RENAME table_name TO new_name;
```

When you rename a table, Oracle automatically transfers indexes, constraints, and grants on the old table to the new one. In addition, it invalidates all objects that depend on the renamed table such as views, stored procedures, function, and synonyms.

```sql
RENAME TABLE table_name_1 TO new_table_name_1,
             table_name_2 TO new_table_name_2,
             table_name_3 TO new_table_name_3;
```

## DROP

### Drop Column using SET UNUSED COLUMN clause

The process of dropping a column from a big table can be time and resource consuming. Therefore, we typically drop the column logically by using the A`LTER TABLE SET UNUSED COLUMN` statement as follows:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name
SET UNUSED COLUMN column_name;
```

```sql
ALTER TABLE suppliers
SET UNUSED COLUMN fax;
```

Once you execute the statement, the column is no longer visible for accessing.

During the off-peak hours, you can drop the unused columns physically using the following statement:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name
DROP UNUSED COLUMNS;
```

If you want to reduce the amount of undo logs accumulated, you can use the `CHECKPOINT` option that forces a checkpoint after the specified number of rows has been processed.

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name
DROP UNUSED COLUMNS CHECKPOINT 250;
```

You can view the number of unused columns per table from the DBA_UNUSED_COL_TABS view:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM DBA_UNUSED_COL_TABS;
```

### Drop Column using DROP COLUMN clause

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name
DROP COLUMN column_name;
```

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name
DROP (
    column_name_1,
    column_name_2
);
```

### DROP TABLE statement

```sql
DROP TABLE schema_name.table_name
[CASCADE CONSTRAINTS | PURGE];
```

In this statement:

- First, indicate the table and its schema that you want to drop after the `DROP TABLE` clause. If you don’t specify the schema name explicitly, the statement assumes that you are removing the table from your own schema.
- Second, specify `CASCADE CONSTRAINTS` clause to remove all referential integrity constraints which refer to primary and unique keys in the table. In case such referential integrity constraints exist and you don’t use this clause, Oracle returns an error and stops removing the table.
- Third, specify `PURGE` clause if you want to drop the table and release the space associated with it at once. By using the `PURGE` clause, Oracle will not place the table and its dependent objects into the recycle bin.
- Notice that the `PURGE` clause does not allow you to roll back or recover the table that you dropped. Therefore, it is useful if you don’t want the sensitive data to appear in the recycle bin.

```sql
DROP TABLE persons;
```

#### DROP TABLE CASCADE CONSTRAINTS example

```sql
CREATE TABLE brands(
    brand_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    brand_name varchar2(50)
);

CREATE TABLE cars(
    car_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    make VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    model VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    year NUMBER NOT NULL,
    plate_number VARCHAR(25),
    brand_id NUMBER NOT NULL,

    CONSTRAINT fk_brand
    FOREIGN KEY (brand_id)
    REFERENCES brands(brand_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

```sql
DROP TABLE brands CASCADE CONSTRAINTS;
```

This statement dropped not only the brands table but also the foreign key constraint fk_brand from the cars table.

#### DROP TABLE PURGE example

```sql
DROP TABLE cars purge;
```

#### Drop multiple tables at once

```sql
CREATE TABLE test_1(c1 VARCHAR2(50));
CREATE TABLE test_2(c1 VARCHAR2(50));
CREATE TABLE test_3(c1 VARCHAR2(50));

BEGIN
  FOR rec IN
    (
      SELECT
        table_name
      FROM
        all_tables
      WHERE
        table_name LIKE 'TEST_%'
    )
  LOOP
    EXECUTE immediate 'DROP TABLE  '||rec.table_name || ' CASCADE CONSTRAINTS';
  END LOOP;
END;
/
```

## TRUNCATE

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE schema_name.table_name
[CASCADE]
[[ PRESERVE | PURGE] MATERIALIZED VIEW LOG ]]
[[ DROP | REUSE]] STORAGE ]
```

- If a table has relationships with other tables via the foreign key constraints, you need to use the `CASCADE` clause.

- `TRUNCATE TABLE CASCADE` statement deletes all rows from the table_name, and recursively truncates down the associated tables in the chain.

- Note that the `TRUNCATE TABLE CASCADE` statement requires the foreign key constraints defined with the `ON DELETE CASCADE` clause to work.

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name
CASCADE;
```

- The `MATERIALIZED VIEW LOG` clause allows you to specify whether a materialized view log defined on the table is to be preserved or purged when the table is truncated. By default, the material view log is preserved.

- The `STORAGE` clause allows you to choose either drop or reuse storage freed by the truncated rows and associated indexes if any. By default, the storage is dropped.

### TRUNCATE TABLE CASCADE example

```sql
CREATE TABLE quotations (
    quotation_no NUMERIC GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
    customer_id NUMERIC NOT NULL,
    valid_from DATE NOT NULL,
    valid_to DATE NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY(quotation_no)
);

CREATE TABLE quotation_items (
    quotation_no NUMERIC,
    item_no NUMERIC ,
    product_id NUMERIC NOT NULL,
    qty NUMERIC NOT NULL,
    price NUMERIC(9 , 2 ) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (quotation_no , item_no),
    CONSTRAINT fk_quotation FOREIGN KEY (quotation_no)
        REFERENCES quotations
        ON DELETE CASCADE
);

INSERT INTO quotations(customer_id, valid_from, valid_to)
VALUES(100, DATE '2017-09-01', DATE '2017-12-01');

INSERT INTO quotation_items(quotation_no, item_no, product_id, qty, price)
VALUES(1,1,1001,10,90.5);

INSERT INTO quotation_items(quotation_no, item_no, product_id, qty, price)
VALUES(1,2,1002,20,200.5);

INSERT INTO quotation_items(quotation_no, item_no, product_id, qty, price)
VALUES(1,3,1003,30, 150.5);
```

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE quotations;
```

The statement failed and Oracle returned the following error

```sql
SQL Error: ORA-02266: unique/primary keys in table referenced by enabled foreign keys
```

To fix this, you add the `CASCADE` clause to the `TRUNCATE TABLE` statement above

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE quotations CASCADE;
```

This statement deleted data from not only quotations table but also quotation_items table.

Notice that if we did not specify the `ON DELETE CASCADE` for the fk_quotation constraint, the `TRUNCATE TABLE CASCADE` statement above would fail.

## VIRTUAL COLUMN

```sql
column_name [data_type] [GENERATED ALWAYS] AS (expression) [VIRTUAL]
```

In this syntax:

- First, specify the name ( column_name) of the virtual column.
- Second, specify the virtual column’s data type. If you omit the data type, the virtual column will take the data type of the result of the expression.
- Third, specify an expression in parentheses after the AS keyword. The values of the virtual column will derive from the expression.
  Note that the `GENERATED ALWAYS` and `VIRTUAL` keywords are for clarity only.

### Creating a table with a virtual column example

```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    ...,
    virtual_column_name AS (expression)
);
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE parts(
    part_id INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
    part_name VARCHAR2(50) NOT NULL,
    capacity INT NOT NULL,
    cost DEC(15,2) NOT NULL,
    list_price DEC(15,2) NOT NULL,
    gross_margin AS ((list_price - cost) / cost),
    PRIMARY KEY(part_id)
);

INSERT INTO parts(part_name, capacity, cost, list_price)
VALUES('G.SKILL TridentZ RGB Series 16GB (2 x 8GB)', 16, 95,105);

INSERT INTO parts(part_name, capacity, cost, list_price)
VALUES('G.SKILL TridentZ RGB Series 32GB (4x8GB)', 32, 205,220);

INSERT INTO parts(part_name, capacity, cost, list_price)
VALUES('G.SKILL TridentZ RGB Series 16GB (1 x 8GB)', 8, 50,70);
```

### Adding a virtual column to an existing table example

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD (
    virtual_column_name AS (expression)
);
```

```sql
ALTER TABLE parts
ADD (
    capacity_description AS (
            CASE
                WHEN capacity <= 8 THEN 'Small'
                WHEN capacity > 8 AND capacity <= 16 THEN 'Medium'
                WHEN capacity > 16 THEN 'Large'
            END)
)
```

### Advantages and disadvantages of virtual columns

Virtual columns provide the following advantages:

- Virtual columns consume minimal space. Oracle only stores the metadata, not the data of the virtual columns.
- Virtual columns ensure the values are always in sync with the source columns. For example, if you have a date column as the normal column and have the month, quarter, and year columns as the virtual columns. The values in the month, quarter, and year are always in sync with the date column.
- Virtual columns help avoid using views to display derived values from other columns.

The disadvantage of virtual columns is:

- Virtual columns may reduce query performance because their values are calculated at run-time.

### Virtual column limitations

These are limitations of virtual columns:

- Virtual columns are only supported in relational heap tables, but not in index-organized, external, object, cluster, or temporary tables.
- The virtual column cannot be an Oracle-supplied datatype, a user-defined type, or `LOB` or `LONG RAW`.
- The expression in the virtual column has the following restrictions:

The expression in the virtual column has the following restrictions:

- It cannot refer to other virtual columns.
- It cannot refer to normal columns of other tables.
- It must return a scalar value.
- It may refer to a deterministic user-defined function, however, if it does, the virtual column cannot be used as a partitioning key column.

### Show virtual columns of a table

```sql
SELECT
    column_name,
    virtual_column,
    data_default
FROM
    all_tab_cols
WHERE owner = '<owner_name>'
AND table_name = '<table_name>';
```

If the value is the virtual_column is `YES`, it means that the corresponding column is a virtual column. Otherwise, it is a normal column.

## PURGE

Use the `PURGE` statement to remove a table or index from your recycle bin and release all of the space associated with the object.
The following statement removes the table test from the recycle bin. If more than one version of test resides in the recycle bin, Oracle Database removes the version that has been there the longest.

```sql
PURGE TABLE test;
```

To remove the entire contents of your recycle bin, issue the following statement:

```sql
PURGE RECYCLEBIN;
```

To see the contents of your recycle bin

```sql
SELECT * FROM RECYCLEBIN; -- Synonym
SELECT * FROM USER_RECYCLEBIN;
```

## COMMENT

Use the `COMMENT` statement to add a comment about a table, view, materialized view, or column into the data dictionary.

```sql
COMMENT ON COLUMN employees.job_id
   IS 'abbreviated job title';
```

To drop this comment from the database, issue the following statement:

```sql
COMMENT ON COLUMN employees.job_id IS ' ';
```

## Database link

- It is an object that enables you to access object on another database. The other databases need not to be an Oracle Database system.

```sql
CREATE [PUBLIC] DATABASE LINK link_name

CONNECT TO remote_username IDENTIFIED BY remote_password
USING 'hostname:port_number/SID' or 'TNS_Name'

CREATE DATABASE LINK ACCDB CONNECT TO scott IDENTIFIED BY tiger USING 'DB1WORLD';
```
